The project was a lot of trial and error to make sure everything was functioning like it was supposed to. 
I did not know how to change the color of text in python or IDLE and so used some code from online to do that and included a link to the code in my project.
I used 3 different files. One of which was the idlecolors that was not mine and the other two were the main program and the wordbank just so it was not too long and overwhelming.
