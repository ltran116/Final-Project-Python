# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Python Wordle Unlimited

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The program grabs a random 5 letter word and gives the user 5 attempts to guess what the word is using hints gained from previous guesses. Green meaning the right letter in the right place; yellow meaning the wrong place for a right letter; black meaning the letter is not in the word.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project will have a 3 different programs used for organization. The first is for coloring strings using idle, the second for the word bank and random word generator, and the third being the main program that asks for user input and returns the colored letters, number of guesses, and the letters that have yet to be used.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Colored output
Unique letter word bank

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Colored output
Unique letter word bank
Functional and applicable prompts regarding user input
Make it look prettier

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Colored output
Unique letter word bank
Functional and applicable prompts regarding user input
Make it look prettier

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First I need to create the word bank and random word generator. Then I need to create the program that will compare the user input to the randomly generated word. Next I need to create the guiding prompts to simplify guessing. Finally I would word on making the program look cleaner.
